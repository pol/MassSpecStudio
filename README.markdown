##Overview
Mass Spec Studio is a software framework designed to provide infrastructure for analysis of mass spectrometry data sets.  The framework provides a pluggable architecture for extensibility to allow rapid development of new analysis packages for specific processing cases. 

As an example, Mass Spec Studio currently includes the analysis package named Hydra.  Hydra is an analysis package designed for both traditional and exploratory treatments of H/DX-MS data.
