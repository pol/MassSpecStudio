Decon2LS Beta

Decon2LS is a software package used for detecting features in MS data 
by using the isotopic signatures of expected components. The tool uses 
different algorithms for different parts of the deconvolution process: 
noise reduction, peak detection, prediction of theoretical isotopic 
envelope and scoring functions that quantitate the quality of signature 
observed in the data. Decon2LS can be used with data from Bruker, Agilent, 
ThermoFinnigan and Micromass if the needed DLLs are installed on the computer.
